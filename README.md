<h1> Project Summary </h1>

Currently, we have a dataset from an ongoing cardiovascular study in residents of the town of Farmingham, Masschusets. The dataset contains the various information regarding the patients' health conditions and personal traits. It includes nearly 3000 records and 17 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavourial and medical risk factors. Using various classification models, we would try to predict the patient has a risk of suffering from coronary heart disease in the upcoming ten years based on the present conditions of the patient.


<h1> Problem Statement </h1>

The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary disease (CHD).
