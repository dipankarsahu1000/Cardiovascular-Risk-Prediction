<h1> Project Summary </h1>

Currently, we have a dataset from an ongoing cardiovascular study in residents of the town of Farmingham, Masschusets. The dataset contains the various information regarding the patients' health conditions and personal traits. It includes nearly 3000 records and 17 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavourial and medical risk factors. Using various classification models, we would try to predict the patient has a risk of suffering from coronary heart disease in the upcoming ten years based on the present conditions of the patient.


<h1> Problem Statement </h1>

The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary disease (CHD).


<h1> Getting to Know the Data </h1>

1. Number of Rows and Columns: 3390 rows and 17 columns.
2. Number of Duplicate Values: 0 duplicate values.
3. Number of Missing/Null Values: 510 duplicate values.


<h1> Understanding The Variables </h1>

 1. **age**: The age of the patient (in discrete numerical values).

 2. **education**: Maybe the education level of the patient (in nominal categorical numbers).
         
 3. **sex**: Whether the patient is male ('M') or female ('F').

 4. **is_smoking**: Whether the patient is smoking currently or not ('YES' or 'NO').

 5. **cigsPerDay**: Number of cigarettes smoked by the patient on an average in a day (discrete numerical values).

 6. **BPMeds**: Whether the patient is taking any medications for blood pressure (nominal categorical numbers: 0 signifying 'No' and 1 signifying 'Yes').

 7. **prevalentStroke**: Whether the patient has a history of stroke (nominal categorical numbers: 0 signifying 'No' and 1 signifying 'Yes').

 8. **prevalentHyp**: Whether the patient has a history of hypertension (nominal categorical numbers: 0 signifying 'No' and 1 signifying 'Yes').

 9. **diabetes**: Whether the patient has diabetes or not (nominal categorical numbers: 0 signifying 'No' and 1 signifying 'Yes').

 10. **totChol**: Measure of the total cholestrol (continuous numerical values).

 11. **sysBP**: Measure of the systolic blood pressure (continuous numerical values).

 12. **diaBP**: Measure of the diastolic blood pressure (continuous numerical values).

 13. **BMI**: The body mass index of the patient (continuous numerical values).

 14. **heartRate**: The heart rate of the the patient (discrete numerical values)

 15. **glucose**: The glucose level of the patient (continuous numerical values).

 16.  **TenYearCHD**: Whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (nominal categorical numbers: 0 signifying 'No' and 1 signifying 'Yes').
